Install
-------

This package isn't really designed to be installed in the Python site packages.
Instead, use this package locally with your source.  For example, if you have
the python file (example.py) you're working on in a directory called 'src',
copy the reader directory like so

src/
  example.py 
  reader/
    ...

Building
--------

From the source directory, run:

  make

Testing
-------

To run the examples:

  python __init__.py 

The tests are written using the docutils framework.  

If everything is ok, no strange messages will appear and a file, test.tif,
should appear.  The file should be a single image of a diagonal line.
