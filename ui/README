================

Usage: ui2.py [options] moviefile [dataprefix]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t, -T, --transpose   transpose images [default: False]
  --frame=N             Start browsing at the N'th frame [default: 0]
  -c CURSOR_SIZE, --cursorsize=CURSOR_SIZE
                        Initial cursor radius in pixels [default: 10 px]
  --cursorpos           Show cursor's center coordinates [default: False]
  --adjuststripes       Adjust odd-scanline bias [default: True]
  --noadjuststripes     Prevent adjust odd-scanline bias [default: False]
  --fps                 Display rendering speed [default: False]

Examples:

  python ui2.py S0.tif 
  python ui2.py S0.tif S0
  python ui2.py S0.tif S0.whisker S0.measurements S0.bar

If no data_files_prefix is given, a default set will be created.  The
prefix will be used to load/save the appropriate files.  Ordering of 
the filenames isn't important.  Filetype is detected accrording to the
file extension.

Action            function
------            --------
Right click       Mark seed for whisker tracking.
                  Attempt backbone tracing.
                  Draw traced whisker backbone.

                    current whisker   
                  If no segment found in cursor, clear
                    any segments in that frame assigned to the
                    whisker    
                  Advance 1 frame
Mouse wheel up    Advance 1 frame
Mouse wheel down  Rewind 1 frame

Notes
-----

If filenames are not completely specified, default names will be guessed.

If an existing data file is found, the whisker data will be loaded.

Normally the left and right arrow keys advance or rewind by one frame.  Holding
down shift, ctrl, and/or alt keys will increase the step size by 10x each.
Hence, holding shift and ctrl (or ctrl and alt, etc...) results in a 100 frame
step.  Holding shift ctrl and alt and pressing left or right, jumps 1000
frames.

The face hint is used on saving to a .measurements file.  The .measurements
file contains, in addition to the identity of segments, measures of follicle
position, angle, etc...  Some of these measures require approximate knowledge
of the center of the whisker pad, which is indicated by the face hint. Currently,
the hint only takes values of 'left','right','top' or 'bottom' that indicate
the side of the movie the face is on.  These options work for a specific class of 
data where the image is cropped so the mouse's face is on one side.
