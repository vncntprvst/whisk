To use these libraries with MSVC++ you must:
- Extract this package to some folder. Be sure to not mix MSVC and MinGW
  folders;
- Get msinttypes and extract it to the same /include folder as above;
- Add that /include folder to "Additional Include Directories";
- Add that /lib folder to "Additional Library Directories";
- Add these libraries to "Additional Dependencies":
    libavcodec.a libavutil.a libavformat.a libavdevice.a libswscale.a \
    liba52.a libmingwex.a libfaac.a libfaad.a libz.a libxvidcore.a libx264.a \
    libpthreadGC2.a libwsock32.a libvorbis.a libmp3lame.a libogg.a
    libvorbisenc.a libvorbisfile.a libtheora.a libgsm.a libvfw32.a libgcc.a
- If you are compiling C programs, "#define inline _inline" before including
  FFmpeg headers.
- If you are compiling C++ programs, "extern "C" {}" around the FFmpeg include
  files.
- If you do not want DWARF2 debug information in your final executable (they
  are useless for the MSVC debugger), run "strip -x" on all *.a files before
  linking. You can get the strip utility from any binutils distribution from
  MinGW. Do not run the strip utility on the final executables generated by
  MSVC as the result is known to be invalid.

To use these libraries with MinGW you must:
- Extract this package to some folder. If you extract them to MinGW's default
  folders, you will not have to add any extra folder flag. If you extract them
  to MinGW's default folders, do not overwrite these files:
    libmingwex.a libwsock32.a libvfw32.a
- If you have not extracted the files to MinGW's default folder, add
  "-I<path to that /include folder>" to CFLAGS;
- If you have not extracted the files to MinGW's lib folder, add
  "-L<path to that /lib folder>" to LDFLAGS;
- Delete these files that came with the package:
    libgcc.a libmingwex.a libwsock32.a libvfw32.a
  Do not delete these original files from your system!
- Add these libraries to LDFLAGS:
    -lswscale -lavdevice -lavformat -lavcodec -lavutil -lz -lpthreadGC2 \
    -lws2_32 -lm -lvfw32 -la52 -lfaac -lfaad -lgsm -lmp3lame -lm -ltheora \
    -logg -lvorbisenc -lvorbis -logg -lx264 -lm -lxvidcore  -lws2_32 -lvfw32
- Alternatively, you may use the pkg-config files. Just remember to change
  "prefix" to the correct value on your system;
- If you do not want DWARF2 debug information in your final executable, run
  the strip utility on the final executable.
