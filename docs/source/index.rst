========

Whisk is a cross-platform package for fully automated tracking of single rows
of whiskers in high-speed video.  It consists of a set of command-line
utilities and a graphical interface for semi-automated tracking. `Python`_ and
`Matlab`_ interfaces are also provided.  Whisk can read `StreamPix SEQ`_ and `TIFF`_ videos as well as
any video format that `FFMPEG`_ can decode.
