Vague Objectives
================
[ ] [!! ] - multidimensional histogramming for conditional probability estimation
[ ] [!  ] - revamp ui
[ ] [!  ] - refactor and cleanup

Current
=======
[ ] [!!!] traj.c     - .measurements file not compatible across x32 and x64 platforms

Tabled
======
[ ] [   ] poly.c     - polynomial stack object for stack based polynomial arithmetic
[ ] [   ] mat.c      - matrix stack object for matrix arithmetic
[ ] [!! ] classify.c - better autotraj for o'connor - allow for range of whisker count
[ ] [!! ] how to handle whiskers entering/leaving the field

User Interface
==============
[ ] [   ] - redo in qt/opengl
[ ] [!! ] - editable segments
[ ] [   ] - drag-and-drop measurements
[ ] [   ] - drag-and-drop trial timeline data
[ ] [   ] - drag-and-drop movie
[ ] [   ] - drag-and-drop segments
[ ] [   ] - drag-and-drop trajectories
[ ] [   ] - drag-and-drop spikes
[ ] [   ] - audio for signals
[ ] [   ] - timeline view

Refactor
========
[ ] [   ] - bar --> stimulus
[ ] [   ] - viterbi.[ch] to hmm.[ch]
[ ] [   ] - bu/bd to interpretable names
[ ] [   ] - add vector max and vector argmax in common.h
            replace existing loops

Done
====
[x] [!!!] measure.c  - utility to update measurements table with bar measurement
[x] [!!!] - incorporate occlusion related measurements into pipeline
[x] [   ] update or remove hmm-lrdel-time with better non-corresponding velcity est.
[x] [!!!] - unify facial ordering priors and temporal coherence priors
[x] [!!!] probability of a transition for non-corresponding types
